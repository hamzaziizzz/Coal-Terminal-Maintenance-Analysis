# Coal Terminal Maintenance Analysis

## Problem Description
You have been hired by a Coal Terminal to assess which of their Coal Reclaimer machines require maintenance in the upcoming month.

These machines run literally round the clock 24/7 for 365 days a year. Every minute of downtime equates to **millions of dollars** lost revenue, that is why it is crucial to identify exactly when these machines require maintenance (neither less or more frequently is acceptable).

Currently the Coal Terminal follows the following criterion: <br>
A reclaimer-type machine requires maintenance when within the previous month there was at least one 8-hour period when the average idle capacity was over 10%.

Idle capacity is a utilization metric which, for the purpose of this project, is defined as:
$${Idle Capacity} = {(𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝑇𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑒 − 𝑁𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦) \over 𝑁𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦}$$

Your task is to find out which of the 5 machines have exceeded this level and create a report for the executive stakeholders with your recommendation.

The coal from the Coal Mines is carried into trains which are several kilometers long to Coal Terminals, which are usually situated at coastline. Then they are further carried into ships to deliver the coal to several companies, governments across the oceans.
